### __Google Data Analytics Certificate Capstone Project__


In a hypothetical scenario, Bellabeat—a health-focused tech manufacturer making products for women—wants to know the following:

What are some trends with one of their products?

How could these trends apply to the Bellabeat customer?

How could these trends help influence Bellabeat’s marketing sdtrategy?


All data was provided through the course in csv files. Data was provided by Bellabeat, which they collected from their customers. Dataset provides information on 30 indivisuals who consented to the release of their health tracker data. (Bellabeat has 3 products that track fitness data (sleep, activity, heartrate, stress, and water intake) Bellabeat also has an app for the products to connect to. Additional data can be added manually via the app.)

Limitations: 

1. We only have data for 30 individuals
2. We don't know that these indivisuals were randomlly selected (they opted to have their data used)
3. The data is missing the water intake tracking data
4. We don't know the total population/how many people own and use these products
5. Data is from 2016—not current
6. Data is stored publically, anyone can access it
